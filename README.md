# Learning and Practice
This is a space to learn and to practice what I am learning.

This repository is divided into several sub-sections.

- Curriculums: Practice projects for different pre-defined learning curriculums that I am following. I.E. The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, #100devs, Coursera Courses, etc.

- Front-End Only Practice: Projects that are front-end focused.

- JavaScript Practice: JavaScript application practice.

- Full-Stack Practice

- Coding Challenges
