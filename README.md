# Learning and Practice
This is a space to learn and to practice what I am learning.

This repository is divided into several sub-sections.

- Curriculums: This is where I save practice projects for different pre-defined learning curriculums that I am following. I.E. The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, #100devs, Coursera Courses, etc.

- Front-End Only Practice: In this folder, I save projects that are front-end focused. I use HTML, CSS, and JS in these projects, although the JavaScript usage here is not back-end functionality but rather primarily for visual presentation.

- JavaScript Practice: This folder is for JavaScript application practice. You will not find full websites here, nor unique ideas. But if you want to see my calculator, my to-do list, etc- come on in.

- Full-Stack Practice

- Coding Challenges
