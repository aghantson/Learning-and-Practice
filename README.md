# Learning and Practice
This is a space to learn and to practice what I am learning.

All projects in these folders are guided, or "tutorial" projects. While some projects may have unique elements, I have not tried to be original. My goals for practice projects here have been:
- Make it work.
- Do it again.

Honestly? Quantity trumps quality in this repository. I have become more and more familiar with best practices along the way, so in some cases, the code smells like garbage. Plus, I have tried not to get too hung up on perfecting tutorial projects, so I make it work and move on.

To see the work that I might have a reason to be proud of, you can visit the repository called 'Passion Projects.'


This repository is divided into several sub-sections.

- Curriculums: This is where I save practice projects for different pre-defined learning curriculums that I am following. I.E. The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, #100devs, Coursera Courses, etc.

- Front-End Only Practice: In this folder, I save projects that are front-end focused. I use HTML, CSS, and JS in these projects, although the JavaScript examples here are not web application focused but rather for visual presentation.

- JavaScript Practice: This folder is for JavaScript application practice. You will not find full websites here, nor unique ideas. But if you want to see my calculator, my to-do list, etc- come on in.

- Full-Stack Practice

- Coding Challenges
