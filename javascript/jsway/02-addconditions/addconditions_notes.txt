if keyword defines a conditional statement
also called a test
associated code block is only run if condition is satisfied (its value is true)
thus, condition is an expression whose evaluation always produces a boolean result
code block associated to an if is delimited by pair of opening and closing brackets
to improve visibility, its statements are generally indented
comparison operators ===, !==, <, <=, > and >= 
else statement can be associated to an if to express an alternative
never both, no limit to the depth of condition nesting
complex conditions can be created using logical operators
logical operators : && || !
switch statement is used to kick off the execution of one code block among many, depending on value of expression
